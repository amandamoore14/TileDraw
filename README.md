# TileDraw
Tiles are randomly drawn onto a canvas, and the user can sort or remove them. The "Draw Tiles" button draws tiles at a random location, with a random color and size. The "Clear" button removes all tiles from the drawing panel. The "Sort" button orders the tiles from largest area on the bottom to smallest area on the top. Left clicking on a tile moves that tile to the top. Shift + left clicking on a tile moves that tile to the bottom. Right clicking on a tile removes that tile from the panel. Shift + right clicking on a tile removes all tiles containing the click from the drawing panel. Typing N on the keyboard adds a new randomly generated tile. Typing S shuffles the tiles to random locations.

To install:
